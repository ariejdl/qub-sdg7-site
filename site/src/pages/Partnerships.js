      <p>
        Partnerships and the support of Non-profit Organizations or Charities
        can be one of the key actions to contribute to the energy transition for
        businesses. They are able to provide specific projects in the areas that
        are most affected. Charities and Non-governmental organizations have a
        clear purpose, which doesn’t include economic growth and financial
        benefit. Therefore, it’s a good option for businesses to support these
        organizations financially, to help them to realise their projects.
