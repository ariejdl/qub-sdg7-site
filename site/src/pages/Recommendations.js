    <h1 className="heading anim-in">Recommendations, Localisation</h1>

<p>SDG localisation refers to the process of turning the goals into reality at a localised level, whilst aligning with communities’ priorities and national frameworks <sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>Implementing appropriate tools and strategies at a local level is fundamental to the design and success of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Localising the SDGs at the business level includes integrating the SDGs into an organisation’s culture, operations and strategies <sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>A transition to clean, efficient, reliable and sustainable energy system needs significant shifts in the demand and supply of energy. Every business has a responsibility to search for and implement energy efficient improvements, perform energy saving actions and source energy from clean sources.  As a business, you can make these commitments.</p>
<p>Energy efficiency means more output for input. Essentially, using less energy for the same output or producing more with the same energy input, and minimising energy waste.  </p>
<p>Implementing energy saving actions leads to ecological advantages and cost savings.  </p>
<p>Often, higher investment costs for efficient appliances are overcompensated by maintenance costs and saved energy leading to net cost savings in the long term.  </p>
 <p>Improving your energy efficiency could increase the profitability of your business through cost savings, protection against potential future energy price increases and even enhancing productivity. Despite popular belief, improving energy efficiency does not mean giving our quality of life. Improving energy efficiency is based, on production optimisation processes, responsible energy consumption, using renewable energy sources and recycling.  </p>
<p>The journey to net-zero, decarbonisation and efficient energy use can be complicated. However, change is necessary, possible to action and people are at the heart of it <sup>3</sup>.</p>
<p>Here are some key steps to effectively localize SDG7:</p>

    <h3>Culture, Engagement and collaboration:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Encourage participation, create a space for your employees to suggest their tips for increasing energy efficiency.</li>
      <li>Promote best practice and expectations on how and when energy should be used</li>
      <li>Organise energy efficiency workshops and training to upskill employees on reducing costs and carbon </li>
      <li>Collaborate with other business to share knowledge and resources related to sustainable energy practises.</li>
      <li>Engage employees, customers, suppliers, and community members in discussions about your energy use and their expectations.</li>
      <li>Make responsible choices throughout your supply chain. Through strategically selecting suppliers across the supply chain, you can choose those who use clean energy and minimise their energy consumption.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Recommendations for efficient energy use:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Conduct Energy Audits</li>
      <li>Conduct an energy usage assessment to identify where and how energy is consumed in your operations.</li>
      <li>Evaluate current practises and policies related to SDG7.</li>
      <li>Identify areas where you could save on energy use, reduce waste and improve efficiency.</li>
      <li>Establish specific, measurable targets and timelines for achieving your energy goals and regularly review. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Simple, no-cost actions:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Use daylight hours for tasks that require more light. </li>
      <li>Activate powersaving mode on all devices in the premises.</li>
      <li>Label appliances so staff know which devices can be switched off at the end of the working day.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Further action:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Fulfil your energy requirements from clean energy sources.</li>
    <li>Make sure you are on the best energy tariff for your business. </li>
    <li>Install a smart meter and energy management system to optimise energy use.</li>
    <li>Reduce heat loss. Space heating is usually the biggest energy cost in a workplace, accounting for 49% of energy use in a non-domestic building.  </li>
    <li>Draught proof the property, insulate and keep windows closed on the premise. </li>
    <li>Thermostats should be programmed to reduce heating/cooling while the building is empty.  </li>
    <li>Use energy efficient appliances that consume less energy. </li>
    <li>Use LED bulbs. This can save up to 80% energy compared to traditional lighting <sup>4</sup> and are made from more environmentally friendly materials. </li>
    <li>Encourage employees to use public transport, walking, or cycling to commute to work.</li>
    <li>Driving habits to be more energy efficient: keep a steady pace and do not drive at excessive speeds; keep the windows closed and set the air conditioning to an average temperature of 21°C; and ensure that tires and the engine are properly maintained.</li>
    <li>If applicable, create products that are clean to use, energy efficient and set at an accessible and affordable pricing point.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Culture, Engagement and collaboration:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Encourage participation, create a space for your employees to suggest their tips for increasing energy efficiency.</li>
    <li>Collaborate with other businesses to share knowledge and resources related to sustainable energy practices.</li>
    <li>Engage employees, customers, suppliers, and community members in discussions about your energy use and their expectations.</li>
    <li>Financially support NGOs with their energy use. Find out more on our partnership page.</li>
    <li>Make responsible choices throughout your supply chain. Through strategically selecting suppliers across the supply chain, you can choose those who use clean energy and minimise their energy consumption.</li>
  </ul>

    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.investni.com/support-for-business/reduce-waste-and-save-energy/energy-efficiency-capital-grant">Energy Efficiency Capital Grant</a> - This grant helps businesses in Northern Ireland to reduce energy costs and build resilience through green efficiency. EECG provides up to £150,000 grant support to buy and install energy efficient equipment that reduces energy and carbon emissions. </p>
    <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.electriccarscheme.com/?utm_source=g&utm_campaign=employee-benefits&utm_content=challenger-ad&gad_source=1&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIwMmRnvKXiQMVe5dQBh0XdiYzEAMYAiAAEgKdjvD_BwE">The Electric Car Salary Sacrifice Scheme</a> - Employees can save 30-60% on any electric car by reducing their salary in exchange for an electric car. This contributes towards making electric cars an affordable option for staff and helping them become net-zero on a personal level for commuting and personal journeys. </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Turn off lights and electrical appliances when they are not in use. Around £45 in GB and £70 in NI could be saved annually just by turning your appliances off standby mode. Nearly half of business electricity usage occurs outside of standard operating hours. </li>
      <li>Avoid overfilling the kettle. This habit costs the UK, £68m annually.</li>
      <li>Install boiling hot water taps, on average, you can use up to 50% less energy.</li>
      <li>Use LED bulbs. This can save up to 80% energy compared to traditional lighting and are made from more environmentally friendly materials. </li>
      <li>Operate with laptops rather than desktop computers. Laptops typically use 85% less electricity over a year than desktop PCs.</li>
    </ul>
