        <strong>
          "Sustainable development is development that meets the needs of the
          present, without compromising the ability of future generations to
          meet their own needs."
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development was adopted in 2015 by the
        United Nations Members. It offers a common blueprint for prosperity and
        peace for humans and the earth. At its core are 17 Sustainable
        Development Goals (SDGs). These are an urgent call for action to handle
        the three interconnected dimensions of sustainability: social,
        environmental and economic.
      </p>

      <p>
        With less than six years till 2030, only 17% of them are on track.
        COVID-19, the cost-of-living crisis, international conflict and the
        climate crisis have created set backs but hope remains and more than
        ever you and your business need to take action to help realise these
        aspirations and create a more equal, prosperous and healthy future.
      </p>

      <p>
        The 17 SDGs are integrated and acknowledge that action in one area will
        either positively or negatively impact outcomes in others.

        This website explores SDG7, Affordable and Clean Energy, a fundamental
        element for a sustainable future. You can do your part to support this
        goal which will not only help the planet but your business outcomes.

      <p>
        <strong>
          SDG7: Access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy
          for all.
        </strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Sustainable Development Goal Seven, alongside, SDG13, contains the least
        amount of targets out of all the goals. However, it still is an
        essential priority and fundamental for our development.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since modern energy was launched over two centuries ago during the
        industrial revolution, it has underpinned human activities and has been
        a major factor for continuous economic growth globally since.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        <img src="pages/overview/2.png" style={{ float: 'left', width: '40%', marginRight: 10, marginBottom: 20 }} />
        From your lighting, mobility, manufacturing, agriculture to the digital
        age, energy plays a vital role in our lives and in meeting your business
        needs.
      </p>

      <p>
        Despite, the advancements and advantages fuelled by energy it has many
        negative implications.Our current reliance on fossil fuels for energy
        production is unsustainable and detrimental to the planet. Worldwide
        emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) from burning fossil fuels total about
        34 billion tonnes (Gt) per year contributing significantly to climate
        change. This means it is paramount to transform how we produce and
        consume energy and implement these changes with immediate effect.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        The goal involves achieving universal access to electricity and clean
        cooking, doubling previous levels of efficiency improvements, and
        exponentially increasing the share of renewable energy in the global
        mix. Attaining SDG7 has a major impact on the environment, business
        processes, health and protecting people from environmental, economic and
        social risks such as the greatest threat of our time, climate change.{" "}
      </p>

      <p>
        Concerningly, The 2023 edition of Tracking SDG 7: The Energy Progress
        Report exclaims that efforts currently are not sufficient to achieve
        SDG7 by 2030.
      </p>

      <p>SDG7 is underpinned by three interlinking targets:</p>

      <h3>Target 7.1: UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO MODERN ENERGY</h3>
      <p>
        By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern
        energy services.
      </p>

      <h3>Target 7.2: INCREASE GLOBAL PERCENTAGE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY</h3>
      <p>
        By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the
        global energy mix.
      </p>

      <h3>Target 7.3: DOUBLE THE IMPROVEMENT IN ENERGY EFFICIENCY</h3>
      <p>
        By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Something to consider</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        Every energy unit of energy conserved through technological or
        behavioural conservation equates to a unit that does not need to be
        produced. Consequently, this reduces the energy requirements for
        renewables expansion and universal access provision, thereby reducing
        the burden of attaining them.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <p>The priorities for implementing SDG 7:</p>

      <h3>
        Target 7.A: PROMOTE ACCESS TO RESEARCH, TECHNOLOGY AND INVESTMENTS IN
        CLEAN ENERGY
      </h3>
      <p>
        By 2030, enhance international cooperation to facilitate access to clean
        energy research and technology, including renewable energy, energy
        efficiency and advanced and cleaner fossil-fuel technology, and promote
        investment in energy infrastructure and clean energy technology.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Target 7.B: EXPAND AND UPGRADE ENERGY SERVICES FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
      </h3>
      <p>
        By 2030, expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying
        modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries,
        in particular least developed countries, small island developing States
        and landlocked developing countries, in accordance with their respective
        programmes of support.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Something to consider</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If changes aren’t effectively implemented, an estimated 660 million
        people will continue to lack access to electricity and approximately 1.8
        billion will have to live without clean cooking fuels and technologies
        by 2030.
      </p>
      <p>
        To achieve universal access to clean energy by 2030, robust policies are
        needed to accelerate electrification, enhance energy efficiency and
        increase investments in renewable energy. This, as well as producing
        progressive innovative solutions and supportive regulatory policies, are
        pivotal to advance towards SDG7 and meet climate objectives.
